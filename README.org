* Proofs

  This is a collection of proof exercises I wrote.
  Currently I have collected examples from Isabelle and Coq.
  (might extend to Agda/Lean).

** Coq

   All proofs for Coq come from the book *Software Foundation*.
   Checkout /SF.org/ for my reading progress:
   - Logical Foundation
   - Programming Language Foundation
   - Verified Functional Algorithm
   - Quickchick
   - Verified C code

** Isabelle

   Some random assignments.
